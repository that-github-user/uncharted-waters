  <h1>Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Navigation in GPS-Denied Environments</h1>
  <div class="abstract-text">
    This paper presents a novel approach to AUV navigation using inertial measurement
    units combined with terrain-relative navigation. We develop a sensor fusion algorithm
    that integrates data from multiple low-cost MEMS IMUs with bathymetric matching to
    achieve sub-meter positioning accuracy in GPS-denied underwater environments. Our
    approach is validated through extensive field trials in littoral waters, demonstrating
    a 60% improvement in position accuracy compared to dead reckoning alone. The system
    is designed for deployment on small-class AUVs operating in contested maritime
    environments where traditional acoustic positioning may be compromised.
